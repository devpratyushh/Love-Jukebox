## Core Features:

- Song Entry Form: Input form to enter song title, artist, date (defaults to today), and optional message. Must conform to Youtube and streaming API search constraints.
- YouTube Search & Embed: Automatically search YouTube for the song based on title and artist inputs from the form using a tool to decide when there is an unambiguous result. Displays YouTube embeds.
- Timeline Display: Display a timeline of added songs grouped by date, including YouTube embeds and personal notes. Songs must be viewable in chronological and reverse-chronological order, as well as a view sorted by the artists' names.
- Local Storage and Access: Basic view of songs stored and accessible for playback. Store minimal amount of data locally using browser to enable app functionality. Do not include a full-fledged database or user authentication, because that exceeds the limits of a minimum viable product.
